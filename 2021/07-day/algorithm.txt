Algorithm 1:
    1. Convert the input into an iterable and count each number using a dictionary.
    2. Get the number with largest appearances and use that number as the crab's meeting point.
    3. Get the fuel cost of each crab submarine doing this operation:
       - Rest the current number by the meeting point number if first is greater than the second.
         Otherwise rest the meeting point number by the current number.
       - Add each result into a variable.
    4. Return the total fuel cost variable as the puzzle answer.
